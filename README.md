Project Description
Ghala Commerce System Simulator

This project is a simplified backend and frontend simulation of Ghala’s core system, which powers WhatsApp commerce for merchants. It enables merchants to configure their preferred payment methods, allows customers to place orders, and handles order status updates based on payment confirmations.

The system includes:

A backend API built with Node.js + Express

A frontend interface built with React + Tailwind CSS

Mock logic for simulating payment confirmation

This project demonstrates handling multiple merchants, dynamic configurations, and asynchronous operations — laying the groundwork for scalable, merchant-centric commerce systems.
